- 👋 Hi, I’m @imashavrik
- years of experience: "when I was 2, I scribbled stuff on a piece of paper and people came over and said it was Java"
- making mobile applications (using DART/FLUTTER) is my first priority, 83.72% of the world have a smartphone.
- actually DART is a poisonous frog.
- aiding others (when I can)  by making tools and writing articles explaining them, cause people don't really read the docs.

- HOBBIES:
- 👀 I love yogurt,seasonally making infosec tools I call them "hntr/hntr_gthrrs/hckrs", and  also love making API's, I find it therapeutic
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elixir, got my eyes on Golang too
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of flutter Projects
- 📫 ubiquitous on twitter @imashavrik

- REMARK:
- excluding being unsympathetic, imposter syndrome, and the dunning kruger effect which are some of the problems scourging the interractions of person to person and     relationships of a person to society,the effects of CORRELATION FALLACY is the worst of all, there is always no way of recovery from it.
- I listen to Drake and Mozart.
- 
- SIMPLY PUT:
- DART/FLUTTER,ELIXIR and GOLANG

- repos going back public on June 30th.
- "in sterquilinis invenitur"
